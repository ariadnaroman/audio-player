# ðŸŽµ  Audio Player

This project represents a demo for a mp3 audio player web component. A live **demo** can be accesed [here](https://audio-player-lsk.web.app/). Note: If the demo is opened from mobile, please open it in browser so audio files can be uploaded.

## ðŸ”¥  How can I use it?

A simple insertion of `<app-audio-player></app-audio-player>` into a html page will automatically add the audio player to the page. The player will be sticky to the bottom of the page so that it's easier to access. The player is responsive to all types of screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. It supports the most basic operations: previous, play, pause, next, and volume adjustments. Besides, it allows loading multiple .mp3 files from computer into the playlist and playing them consecutively. Audio files can be removed from the list or appended to it. The entire list can be shown by clicking the list button. The list also shows the current audio file and allows the user to select any song to play. 

## ðŸ”¨ What's it made of?

The player was made only using html, css and typescript in an Angural environment, no third party library was used. The icons of the player are taken from [Material](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline). 

## ðŸ”§ How do I run it?

After cloning the project, `npm install` should be run in order to install all dependencies from package.json. When the install is over, a `ng serve` command will load the app on `http://localhost:4200/`.

## ðŸ’¥ What else can be done?

Future work would add caching of the playlist, design improvements and ordering the audio files by drag and drop. 

## ðŸŽ¶ Let the music play!
